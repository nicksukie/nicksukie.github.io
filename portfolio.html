          <p>One will notice a long hiatus here. This is a result of my focusing on my degree, which was chemical engineering, as well as my process of personal growth wherein I struggled with a series of severe identity crises one after another for
            about 5 years. No doubt the major was a big contributor to such process, but the end result is that I know well where I stand and what my strengths/weaknesses are better than if I had not experienced it.</p>
