  <h2>I'm Nick.</h2>
  <br>
    <h5>Welcome to my world.</h5>
<br>




    <p class=""> <span class="para-em">I'm on a journey</span> to create value through finding joy in whatever I do. Here, I'll be sharing some of the stories from that journey, which has so far taken me across 24 countries and 78 cities. But this is far from a travel blog.

             That's the same as if I were to say it's a house blog, because I'm writing it from home. The places are simply the context for the "adventure" - which is actually just another word for being outside of one's comfort zone - the place where the most learning and growth happens. It just so happens that it's easiest to be outside of your comfort zone when you're in a place where you know nobody, and even better if those people whom you don't know don't speak your language.
    <br />  <br />
      There are some themes I typically write about - startups and technology, mindfulness and positivity, the importance of financial planning (but not in a boring way), and people, and situations  who've left impressions on me - but I like to think of this as a compilation of various experiences wherefrom one can elicit an overarching, generalized truth, if not just about me, about human nature itself. Because if something's true somewhere, it's true everywhere.
