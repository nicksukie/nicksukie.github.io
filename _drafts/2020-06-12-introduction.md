[*"The medium is the message"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message). A powerful statement and one which could be described as having special relevance to my life in the past few years. The idea alone is enough to explain why I've felt the need to create my own _medium_ where I can publish my  writing independently.  
<br/>
 
 I've gone through a handful of different outlets for my writing over the years: a travel blog on Tumblr,  a music blog on Blogger, a travel blog on the website of my university's international programs office, which likely has never been read by anyone but myself (but which was the basis for a  scholarship to study abroad so I'm not complaining). And more recently, the platform _called_ Medium, which in itself is a medium with very particular dynamics, such that although it aims to be a neutral platform for people to share their views on all things, it indeed is geared toward a particular type of content.  
 <br/>

 Here, I can write whatever I want to write about without having to worry about how it will be received, as dictated by the trends and dynamics of the given platform. My platform, my dynamics.   
 <br/>
 
 That's all I have in the way of an introductory note to this new mechanism for my personal expression, and I appreciate anyone who may take an interest in what I have to say. I really mean that. I'll be posting updates to new posts on Twitter, so be sure to follow me [there](http://www.twitter.com/nicksukie) if you'd like to stay updated.
