I arrived in China knowing only the characters for 1 through 10.  I could also introduce myself, and tell someone I could speak a little bit of Chinese (but really, that sentence *was* the little bit).   
<br/>

I ordered my first few meals with body language and by pointing at pictures on menus.   
<br/>

<span class="img-caption mb3">Many menus in China are just long lists of dishes, making it all the more important to learn how to read characters!</span>
I very quickly got fed up with not being able to communicate with people.   
<br/>

My only other experience learning a new language was Spanish in school. This was different. Learning a language on the go, while in a place where you are surrounded by it everyday is a totally different story. On the one hand, you have constant exposure, making it potentially easy to pick up new words/expressions on a regular basis. But at the same time, there's just so much that you can't understand, surrounding you constantly, that it can be overwhelming.   
<br/>

I remember looking at a sign at the top of a building, thinking, there's no way anyone can ever learn this language. At that time, characters to me just looked like amorphous, unintellible square shaped scribbles. There was no logic to it.   
<br/>

But at the end of six months, I was able to have basic conversations, verbally and written (by typing... handwriting is a different story), and could travel alone with no problem. I started without any structure, a raft at sea, and I eventually made it to dry land. But you don't have to be a raft. What I'm going to share here is how to build yourself a sturdy ship so your voyage to fluency can get off to as smooth as start as possible, and be robust enough to weather any storms that may get in its way later on.  
<br/>

Learning Chinese for someone who speaks a latin or germanic rooted language (i.e. English, Spanish, French, etc) is very difficult because it requires a different mindset. Here, I'll introduce some important concepts which I think will get you into that mindset. Keep in mind that this is not intended to be a *LESSON*, but just a compilation of tips and examples to get your head in gear for the ride.

First, before reading this post, I encourage you to spend some time studying [*pinyin*](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Pinyin-pronunciation-tables-with-audio), the phonetic system for representing Chinese syllables in letters. It's very straightforward and it'll save you an incredible amount of time with pronunciation later on. Take a few hours and just cram it. Then, when your ready to continue reading, I highly encourage you to have [Google translate](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=%E6%84%9F%E8%B0%A2%E6%82%A8%E7%9C%8B%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2) (browser) or [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) (mobile) open, so you can look up the pronunciations of the characters in the examples below. Learning Chinese is as much about the time you put into it as it is how good you are at using resources. No one person, app, or blog, can teach it to you completely, and you'll often have to refer to complementary resources along the way if you want to make it sink it as well, and as quickly, as possible.     
<br/>

(Side note: I'll be using simplified Chinese in the examples below. I learned simplified first, so it comes more natural to me, but it doesn't really matter which one you learn first. It's not hard to jump from one to the other. They're usually pretty similar, give or take a few strokes.)  
<br/>

### Why is learning Chinese so hard?  


Chinese is hard because it's a different paradigm, a completely different mindset than the one you are used to if you grew up only speaking a European language. It's not a matter of learning verb conjugations and vocabulary (once you learn Spanish, for example, you can learn French or Italian incredibly quickly just by substituting the verb conjugations and vocabulary - all the patterns and structures are the same). Chinese, I'd argue, is one of the hardest languages in the world. Even native Chinese speakers take around 10 years to become completely fluent when they are kids, and it only became common for the average Chinese person to read Chinese within the last 100 years or so. It's no surprise it's so complicated, as it's one of the [oldest living languages on the planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone). Over all those years, it's evolved and grown to be nuanced and layered in ways that English is not.   
<br/>

But don't let the complexity turn you off. It becomes much easier once you dive into it. As long as you go into it *knowing* it will be very different, you won't be surprised. Consider it an opportunity to break down your conceptions of the world and reform them in a new way. No, of course, you won't forget your native language, but you might find that what you know, or knew about the world is largely influenced by the words you use and the concepts they convey. And so by learning a new language, especially one so different, you'll be able to open your eyes to a new way of looking at the world. It may sound a little scary, but trust me, it's a lot of fun, and it'll be worth it when you can communicate with people from a different part of the world and understand them at a deeper level than that of just a tourist or a spectator. I'd also suspect that it may make people more tolerant and sympathetic to one another when they can speak each others' language.   
<br/>


### Chinese characters are not read phonetically, but they've got rhythm

Whereas English has a visual and sound component to each letter, Chinese characters are not phonetic. In English, you could read a word you've never seen before by sounding out the letters. In Chinese, there are no letters. If you see a character you've never seen before, you cannot pronounce it. What that means is, every Chinese character has to be _memorized_ in its appearance and corresponding meaning. This sounds almost impossible. But strangely, it works. The more characters you know, the quicker you'll able to pick them up. There's a sort of visual "rhythm" to the way the characters represent different sounds. At some point you won't recognize a character, but once someone tells you how to pronounce it, you'll think "oh, yeah, it does look like a *jing*".   
<br/>

Here it's also worth introducing the concept of radicals: the sub-components which each character is made up of. A character usually has a sound component, and a meaning component, but to judge sound and meaning off of them solely would be overly simplifying it. They can give hints, but not much more.   
<br/>



### A character is concept, not a word 

This is the part where is gets kind of abstract and confusing. The first thing you need to know is that an individual character is not necessarily a word on its own. A character, first and foremost, represents a concept. There are *concepts* in that are represented across several different Chinese which might be represented by a single word in English.  
<br/>
  <img src="/assets/images/china-early/strengthen-the-sense-of-civilization.jpg" class="in-post-img block mx-auto">
<span class="img-caption mb3">A good way to pick up some new characters is from some of the many signs displayed in public places, like this one.  Very philosophical if you ask me.</span>
Additionally, while a character in itself *may* be a word on it's own, most words (with the exception of grammar particles and common verbs) have two characters. Each of the two characters may be similar in the concept they convey, but combining them together gives the word the specifity so you know when/which context to use it in. Having two characters per word also makes it easier to distinguish between similar sounding words in spoken Chinese, since the language only has a total of 413 syllables to make up all of its thousands of characters. 

Now, let's put this idea into practice. In example below, we'll see how  the meaning of two characters combines can be pretty drastically different from either of the individual characters it's composed of.  
<br/>

<div class="example-block">
<p>
<h3> Example 1 </h3>

爱 = love (can be used for romantic love as well as saying you love to do something, etc)  
<br/>

好 = good (used in much the same way as the English good*)    
<br/>  
爱好 = hobby</p>     
<br/> 
*Fun fact, Chinese doesn't have a word for 'bad'. In most cases, bad is just 'not good', or 不好
   
</div>

<br/>
Here we can see that two characters, 'love' and 'good', are combined to form the word 'hobby'. That's not completely intuitive. That's the first point we need to understand: Chinese is very much a contextual language. Characters mean different things depending on ther context, i.e. depending on the other characters around them. There are, of course, characters which have meanings on their own, but in most cases, their meaning is based on traditional usage, as opposed to an inherent definition.  
<br/>

 
<br/>
### A character can have multiple meanings depending on its context
<div class="example-block">
<p>
<h3> Example 2 </h3>
Let's take the character 福, for example. 福 means luck, fortune, or prosperity.  
<br/>

In Chinese culture, this character can be seen in many place as a symbol which is used to attract good fortune, and is placed on entrances to homes and businesses, especially during holidays. The meaning of the word comes from its usage in certain tradition contexts, and not so much based on its fundamental "definition". There are also other character which mean 'luck' in Chinese, but you cannot paste them onto your door (I mean you can but people will either be really confused or laugh at you).  </p></div>
<br/>

<span class="img-caption mb3">A large display of the character 福, seen in an art museum in Taiyuan, Shanxi province.</span>

The the main point here is, don't think of characters as fixed words with fixed meanings. Better yet, don't study characters individually at all. Study *expressions*.   
<br/>

One of the biggest mistakes I made when learning Chinese was learning characters one by one. This is a fatal error that probably set me back months if not years in my progress. As a result of that I was able to read signs and names really well (I spent a lot of time translating names of subway stations in Beijing), but I struggled with reading anything sentences, let along paragraphs longer than a few characters. That's why I recommend learning Chinese, not on a character basis, and not even on a *word* basis, but on an *expression* basis. Learning expressions early on will expose you to all different kinds of grammar structures and colloquialisms which will be incredibly confusing, because the characters will mean different things that what you learned them to be.  
<br/>
 
### The rule rule of Chinese grammar is... there is no grammar?

That brings me to the next important conceptual point: Chinese doesn't have grammar. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but for all intents and purposes, for a beginner *it doesn't*. Chinese has the SVO (subject-object-verb) grammar pattern, like English, but that's where the similarity ends. Chinese does *not* have, tenses, plurals, verb inflections or conjugations. The grammar is also, for the most part *contextual*.   
<br/>

For example, one of the most common grammar characters (called particles), is 了. This character basically implies that something changed. It's ofted taught as the equivalent of 'ed' for past tense in English, but it's not and anyone who tells you that is cheating you. Better to *know* that it's complicated in the beginning and not completely understand it, than assume it's simple and then try to fix your understanding later on.   
<br/>

<div class="example-block">
<p>
<h3> Example 3 </h3> 

我昨天吃了蛋糕 = I ate cake yesterday.   
<br/>
我开心了 = I'm happy (I became happy/I'm happy now)   
<br/><br/>

In both of these sentences, the 了 is signifying that something was changed. In the first one, it's the action of eating. You are not still eating and you are not saying a general statement that you ar a person who eats cake, so the 了 signifies that the action of eating cake is over.  
<br/>
<br/>
In the second sentence, the thing that changed is your emotional state. I + happy + 了 (change of state). I wasn't happy before, now I am. This sentence would be used if you were sad or disappointed about something and somebody tried to cheer you up. If you just wanted to say generally how you're feeling (no change), you'd say 我很开心.  
<br/>
</p></div><br/>

Another very common mistake is to assume, like I did, that you can just fit words into grammar patterns and people will understand what you mean, even if it's not quite perfect. This might be the case with other languages with similar grammar to English. But with Chinese, don't be surprised if you say something in Chinese that sounds perfectly logical to you, because you combined words in a grammatical structure that would make sense in English, and the person whom your're speaking to has know idea what you mean. To express yourself in Chinese, you can't just speak in Chinese. You have to *think* in Chinese.  
<br/>
<div class="example-block">
<p>
<h3> Example 4 </h3> 
If you're in China and you request an Uber (known there as Didi) and it arrives in two minutes, you might be inclined to tell the driver:
 你(you) 到了 (arrived) 很快 (very fast).
 He will probably shake his head and start driving, confused as to what you meant. Instead, such a thought could be expressed in Chinese as: 你(you)很早(very early)到达(arrived). But that's a bit formal.  Remember, Chinese is a contextual language. You could probably just say, 那么快！(that was quick!).

The above were some tips that I wish I had known before I started learning Chinese. There are plenty of other pitfalls you could run into, but I don't want to overwhelm anyone right off the bat. And these are, for me, some of the most important things to be aware of in the beginning of the learning process. I hope my sharing these observations and learnings might be able to prevent others from running into the same stumbling blocks I did. And finally, if there's one last piece of advice I would give, it's *if I could do it, you can too*. Yeah, it sounds like a cliche. But these are words I live by. If anyone could do it before me, I could too, and I did. Good luck, and 加油.
