It was my first ever backpacking trip, and practically, my first time ever traveling abroad. A solo adventure planned minimally. I only knew what cities I intended to be in and when - but even that was subject to change depending impulse or a social opportunity.  <br/>

I got off the plane and getting out of the airport was the first hurdle. At the time of writing, getting off a plane in a foreign country having done little research as to how to get from there to anywhere is practically standard procedure. If it were me today, I'd able to wade my way through any of the more-likely-to-be-ripped-off methods of transporation and find the most legitimate, most convenient one (balancing speed and cost), almost as a matter of instinct. But at that time, I was helpless. I remember spending way too long in the bathroom of the airport. I was checking the compartments in my bags, reorganizing what was on hand in my smaller bag vs. the larger overnight backpack, what was in my pockets, taking my glasses out of their case and putting them on my face (I believed for some unthought-out reason that traveling could be dangerous without them), and at some point several minutes later, I finally emerged.   <br/>

I managed to board a bus to the city center. I looked out the windows at that old Spanish architecture. Starting to let it sink in. Farther away from home than I'd ever been. In a different country - no, an entirely different _continent_.  <br/>

I got off the bus and walked into the subway station. Old, dark, desolate. But somehow quaint, in a European way. In those days I travelled without a data plan. Smartphones existed, but this was a time before I was fully integrated into the world of modern technology, so I relied on public signage for navigation. That, and of course, the old GPS alternative - asking questions to other humans. I also had a notebook. A small, spiral bound notebook which I kept notes in. Directions, meeting times, addresses and phone numbers of people I might need to reach and places I might need to be. In that notebook, I'd written some very vague directions to the hostel I'd booked prior to the trip upon recommendation from an acquaintance back home. The notes were not intentionally vague, of course. I only realized they were vague after I started trying to follow them.  <br/>

So I consulted my small notebook and took the subway to the name of the station I wrote down. It was a long way. The last station of the line.  <br/>

I got off the subway train. Got out of the station. Nothing but condominiums around me. I was in some kind of residential area. A mistake. I must've gotten off at the wrong station.  <br/>

 It turns out, I'd written get off at station XXX, on the train in the direction of station YYY (the terminal station), and instead of getting of at XXX I'd actually gone to the terminal station, YYY.  <br/>

But, instead of going right back into the subway station and continuing to my originally intended destination, I decided to walk around. What's my reason for traveling? I asked myself. It wasn't to see anything in particular. I wasn't even particularly interested in _Barcelona_ itself, or any of the specific tourist sights that the city boasted. I was there to observe. To see how life was in another part of the world. This could be done in a city center, a residential zone, a supermarket, a . As long as I was in Spain (read: not in my home city/state/country), _everything_ was interesting to me. So I just walked around those residential complexes. I found a small park. I put my bags on a bench. I smelled the Spanish air. Gazed at the Spanish clouds. Took in the Spanish sunlight. The sky, I noted, was a different shade of blue than I'd ever seen it at home.  <br/>

My first ever impression of a foreign country was, as a result of a logistical mistake, a quiet, low-key observation of a residential zone in Barcelona, and I enjoyed it. It was then I learned about the deeper meaning of travel for me. From then on I'd make it a regular activity, to explore, relatively aimlessly, the non-touristy parts of a city. Just to observe the way things looked. Just to take in the feeling of the place, to get an impression, not just from a select few overly crowded gathering points, but from the mundane, from the *way things were* in all their peculiarly different ways from anywhere else. More often than not, I'd see something inspirational or thought-provoking. Without having the expectation of something amazing, exciting, or otherwise stimulating, you are almost forced into appreciation of the little things. The farawayness of it all, casting a foreign hue on everything, making it stand out, leaving an impression.  <br/>

I took a few photos and headed back to the station. After this unexpected detour, I was ready for the real adventure to start.

And that may have been the moment that defined all of my travels up to now. 

A template, constructed on the fly, which all future trips seems to follow. It went like this:  

It was around 9am on a weekday, and I had a massive backpack on my back.

But I'm in Spain. Should I sum up the five years of Spanish I took from 8th to 12th grade and ask for directions in Spanish. Or should I assume that everyone speaks English, as many (American) tourists do? After all, Barcelona is pretty much a tourist hub.
