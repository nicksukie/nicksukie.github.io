I was always destined to learn Japanese. It was probably a twist of fate that I ended up going to China first and making that my primary second language. But Japan always had a special significance in my life, due to some childhood cultural influences. That's why before I started my adult life of limited vacation days and stifling tuition bills, I made it my goal to spend some time in Japan. And with my lifehacking skills on high during college, I somehow made that happen. 

Leading up to my time in Japan, I spent several weekends in libraries with Japanese textbooks, consuming as much as I could leading up to my indefinite voyage (well before I even had an opportunity to go there), so I'd get off at least on better footing than I did landing in China a year or so earlier. 


I arrived in Japan with an academic understanding of the language. And if there's anything I've learned about the word "academic" over the years, it's that it's synonymous with "useless in the real-world" (see, traveling can teach you things about your own language, too!).

The thing that did help me pick up Japanese when I was there, however, was my knowledge of Chinese. That's because a big part of the Japanese language is directly influenced by Chinese, and they even borrow many Chinese characters, using them in conjuction with the Japanese exclusive phonetic "alphabets", hiragana and katakana. 

Kanji (Chinese characters used in written Japanese) are usually used for concrete words and concepts, whereas hiragana is used mostly for grammar, and finally, katakana is used to spell out foreign names in Japanesified pronunciation. Put them all together, and you could ahve a sentence that looks like this: _____

One of the complicated parts for me though, was that, as opposed to Chinese where each character has only one pronunciation, in Japanese each Kanji has two or more pronunciations: one which is based off of the Chinese (you can still hear a slight resemblance to the Chinese pronunciation of some of them even though they were adapted from an ancient form of Chinese, which is much different from today's mandarin), and another one (or two) which comes from native Japanese.  This was originally a fear inducing thought: "you thought Chinese was hard? Well trying doubling the amount you need to memorize!" 

But actually, to my great delight, Japanese turned out to be so much easier to learn than Chinese. The reason for this is the grammar. While not too similar to English (Japanese uses an SOV grammar pattern: "I to the store went"), it was a heck of a lot easier than Chinese, which hardly has any fixed grammar rules at all. With Japanese, you could learn the tenses, which changed the suffix of the verbs just like English, and then add in some prepositions, nouns, and then flip the subject and object and you'll be able to functionally express yourself. 

The complexifying factor for Japanese, though, is the formality levels. While Chinese is notoriously casual (why use more words when you can say the same thing with less!), Japanese has a pretty strict layer of formality, which takes into account the environment you are in or the person you are talking to, and uses that to inform the grammar. This means that for any given thought, there will be three or even four ways to express it depending on the formality of the situation.

While I still don't think this gives it a challenge nearly as insurmountable as the *third tone* in Chinese, it does make things  slightly more complex. That being said, formality does become pretty natural after a while, so you shouldn't have to spend too much time thinking about it once you get used to it.
