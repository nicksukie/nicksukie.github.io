If there's any good reason to write, it's to preserve the memory of experiences of which there is no other proof.

Not because memories in and of themselves are worth preserving, but because of the enjoyment we get from sharing them with others. Why was Instagram such a revolutionary piece of software even though it may use of a *very* simple photo sharing feature? Because it allowed people to express themselves quickly and concisely. Before Instagram was dominated by influencers and professional travel photographers (nothing against those people), it was a place where people casually shared interesting or aesthetically pleasing aspects of their day to day lives. Self-expression is one of the fundamentals of human nature, and modern software allows us to do that more easily than ever.

I'm not accustomed to writing about individual experiences. For whatever reason, the way my mind works, I tend to write about broad conceptual phenomena and trends (see previous paragraph) - things tangentially related to myself but not explicitly *about* me or my life.

So one of the purposes of this format, for me, is to creating a forcing function to do just that, to share individual experiences rather than broad conceptual phenomena. I do [use](https://www.instagram.com/nicksukie/) Instagram, but there are plenty of memories worth sharing of which there is no visual representation. The themes, the threads than run through life, those things that span longer, than run deeper, than a mere capture of a moment. And with that, let's get to today's non-conceptual, non-phenomenological experience worth sharing.

#### A Trainstation in Bangkok and a Bootleg Smartphone

My second backpacking trip ever started in Bangkok. But I did not intend to stay there. I was interested in nature - beaches and palm trees. I arrived at night, and booked a hostel in one of the tourist areas of the city. The following day I headed to the trainstation and purchased a combo bus-ferry ticket to an island off the Eastern coast of the country. I had a few hours to spare, so I walked around the neighborhood. I ventured into Chinatown by foot. Had lunch. My mind was in a very strange place - I'd just flown in from *China*, and now here I am, in Chinatown of a country neighboring China. _Why does this feel more like the Chinatown in my hometown than a town in China?_ I wondered, a mysterious I have yet to reconcile completely, even after having visited dozens of Chinatowns around the world since.

I meandered with my overly-stuffed massive backpack back to the train station. I came across a stall selling mobile phones. I thought, this might not be the best place to get a phone, but...

Two days earlier...

I was getting ready to leave Beijing. I returned by bike and phone to one of the three proprietors of the now defunct internship agency which provided them six moths earlier. Upon meeting him one weekday morning outside his apartment building, he told me: 1) he was not aware of the bike at all and 2) that I could keep the phone, an inexpensive entry-level smartphone. Also my first ever smartphone. I told him I'd just spent several hours the night before cleaning off all my data and that I'd like to give it back, as I was expecting to. He obliged.

And so now, two-days later, I'm without a smartphone, starting a new trip in a Bangkok train station looking at smartphones. Although I knew there was something shady about it, I couldn't resist. It was a white Samsung with a steel-blue backplate. It looked and felt so fresh. And it also worked, surprisingly. I bought it. $50.  In those days, I barely knew what a smartphone was for. But I knew I needed one.

A month later, it broke. I don't regret it. If it had lasted any longer, I would have lost many more pictures than I did. What I regret is the next phone I bought, for more than $50, the SD card for which crapped out on me almost a year later.

More than a thousand pictures. Gone.

Long story short: this blog is a symbolic commemoration of those lost thousand photos and the moments they represented. But more than that, the feelings that existed within those moments, and their accumulation towards the greater journey. Even if the pictures are gone, the memories live on, within me of course, but now here as well, in this virtual home for memories, shared with the world so that they might bring the slightest amount of joy, or inspiration to those who read them.
