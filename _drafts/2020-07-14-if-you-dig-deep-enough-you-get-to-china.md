Starting a new life in a new place is tiring enough to do once, let alone five times in two years. By the time I got to Japan, my fifth destination, I can say honestly, it was a little bit underwhelming. Not to say Japan wasn't as unique or interesting as I'd expected, but simply because I'd learned to be a little bit more reaslistic with my expectations before arriving anywhere.  
<br/>

For the most part, though, I didn't have any expectations at all when I got off the plane in Beijing a year and a half earlier.    
<br/>


I was coming off of my first Europe backpacking trip and jumping straight into a new world. I liked to say: I was going to China, so I decided to stop off in Europe because it was on the way (but really, I wanted an excuse to go backpacking in Europe). After that, arriving in Beijing - my first time ever in Asia - was an incredible culture shock. Doubly shocking, as a matter of fact, because I felt that Europe was already equally as different to home as Beijing was, but different in exactly the opposite direction. It took me almost a month to get over my European honeymoon phase - the relaxed vibes, the siestas, the endless good food and general enjoyment of life at all moments despite what chaos may be going on in the world or even around the corner - Europeans, simply put, know how to <em>live</em>. And now jump to Beijing, one of the most densely populated cities in the world where people seem to be always moving, always getting something done, never not doing <em>something</em>. Needless to say, the vibe was a little different here.

When I got off the plane at Beijing International Airport at 1 AM, the subway system had already shut down for the night. At the arrivals gate, there was a horribly grainy sounding loudspeaker shouting something in a language I couldn't understand. There was a crowd of men standing just beyond the exit, wearing black jackets, smoking cigarettes, all shouting at me in broken English - no, not broken, it was perfectly fluent: 
'Hello! Where are you going?" - the only sentence they needed to know. They were the unofficial taxi drivers, back when there was no Uber and little regulation - all vying to take advantage of a promising economic opportunity: picking up a foreigner from the international arrivals gate of the airport, someone who hopefully has never been to China before, nor speaks Chinese. That person would ideally not be familiar with typical taxi fare rates in the city, nor with the exchange rate so that he could calculate how much he was paying - to fall prey to their enterprising business model.    
<br/>

That person was me. And so there I went, with a cigarette smoking, black jacket wearing, non-English speaking Beijing entrepreneur from the airport to my hostel for the night - a fifteen dollar value for fifty dollars, with a bottle of water thrown in. He was a friendly man, smiling a lot (but who wouldn't be, he'd practically won the lottery that night), and even tried to make some basic conversation: "Where are you from?...". It didn't go much further than that. And when we arrived, thirty minutes later, he graciously accompanied me to the lobby to make sure I was in the right place. I was.

I checked in to the hostel. It looked and felt different from any other hostel I'd been in before, not least because <em>nobody was speaking English</em>. (The first thing to know about Chinese hostels is that, while every other hostel I've been to previously was host to travelers from around the world, Chinese hostels are largely full of travelers from other parts of China. It's a big country).    
<br/>


I got into my dorm bed, bottom bunk, and thought of that vast city I saw go by me during the taxi ride: the brightly lit neon lights forming shapes with meanings I knew nothing of, adorning unornate concrete buildings lining wide roads as far as the eye could see in every direction. <em>Night in Beijing can be an eery thing for someone who doesn't know what to expect. </em>   
<br/>


And with those images, along with the words <em>what in the world have I done?</em> going through my head, I drifted to sleep. That night, my brain flipped upside down. (after all, if you dig a hole deep enough in Pennsylvania, you get to China, right?).

The next day I was to rendezvous with the internship coordinator and move in to what would be my home for the next six months. It was a beautiful sunny day. Blue sky. Fall breeze. The wide streets looked much less imposing in the daytime. The city, now in color, was much more welcoming than it seemed the night before.   
<br/>

We reached the apartment on the third floor of an old, minimal, almost Soviet-style apartment block just inside the Third Ring Road. My flatmate: an English teacher at a local elementary school who'd never spoken English to a non-Chinese person before. I put my bags in my room, big enough with a bed and a desk, and a large window from which I'd be able to gauge the daily pollution levels each morning.   
<br/>


 I'd start work on Monday. My new life had begun.
