I was a suburban middle class kid, and probably from playing too many video games when I was younger, I realized that life could be much more interesting that the one I was living. So as soon as I possibly could, I took a trip. A long trip. Not just a vacation, but a venture into another culture and society much deeper than that of a tourist.  
<br/>

I followed the typical "go to college and get a good education" life path without thinking too much about it. While I think I should have thought a little bit more about what I wanted to do with my life prior to committing myself to a university with $40k a year tuition, what I did was probably the next best thing (aside from taking a year off or dropping out completely).   
<br/>

What I did was, through applying to various programs within the university, managed to live abroad in 5 different countries for a year and a half, DURING my college period. So basically, because I wasn't too fascinated with my major, I gave my college life a purpose other than simply studying and getting good grades. At the end of it, I would end up with a degree, but that wasn't the main goal for me. The goal I set for myself was not an academic one - my goal was to understand *the world* as well as possible, while I was still in college not having to worrying about paying bills etc. The reasons were kind of vague. I knew that having that understanding would help me in some way, but didn't really pinpoint it at the time. I was more propelled out of an inherent urge rather than a logical plan leading up to something well-defined and expected.

It was a combination of luck and determination. I went to a school which had a co-op program (a 5 year bachelors degree with 1.5 years of work experience squeezed in, no summer breaks). While most people use that as an opportunity to gain valuable working experience in the field  in which they intend to pursue after college, I used it as an opportunity to see the world. I did three co-ops in three different countries (six months, three months, and three months). My only regret was not doing the first co-op abroad. On top of that, I enrolled in two study abroad programs, in two different countries, in-between the working periods, glueing them together with more time abroad.  
<br/> 

I'dd also travel in between semesters (i.e. work for six months, and then travel for a couple weeks before next the academic term started, and repeat), adding a few more countries to my repertoire.  
<br/>

It's difficult to get really integrated in a new country in 3 to 6 months. I tried to do that and was extremely exhausted after the 3rd or 4th country. But it paid off, for me at least. I got what I wanted, a broader view of the world than I had before. I managed to pick up some language skills, and, of course, made some friends along the way. When I got home, I was honestly pretty bored. And in a way, that's kind of a good thing. I wasn't constantly looking for exciting things to do. I spend my last year and a half of school pretty much living low-key and studying / trying to graduate with a decent GPA. I knew that the excitement would be waiting for me the next time I could travel.

The reason traveling is beneficial is because it puts everything in perspective. It's like a forced meditation session - allowing you to look at your life, your situation, in the third person. Where you are outside of your usual context, things that were previously imperceptible become visible. It's not just about recognizing your flaws and fixing them. It's more about undersstanding that there is more than one possible way to live, and by exposing yourself to different cultures and lifestyles, you have a bigger pool of options to choose from for your own life.   
<br/>

I'm now in my late-mid twenties and I'm just getting my career started. So there's definitely a tradeoff to using your early twenties as a time for primarily traveling. Overall it's not good or bad. For me it was experience I think I needed to go through to get to the point where I am now.   
<br/>

I also think traveling for a year or so could be extremely beneficial to many lost young people, as I was, so if you are young and lost, I do encourage you to consider it as an option. Ideally, do it before enrolling in college. There are plenty of programs which require practically no budget, like workaway, woofing, and helpx, in addition to all kinds of organizations that place you as an English teacher in foreign countries. Spend a year abroad, and then come back and I think you'll have a better idea of what you want to do with your life.

Starting in my second year, I applied to a program which matched up students with employers in Beijing. It was also ttopped off with s guaranteed scholarship for any student who went through the program, notwithstanding any paiid that the company would provide. I was lucky to find a company which paid interns pretty well,
