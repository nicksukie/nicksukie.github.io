title: "Where in the world is Singapore, and what language do they speak?"
excerpt: My first sojourn in Asia's enigmatic miracle city

The idea was to go from Bangkok to Singapore by land, and from Singapore, fly to Germany where I'd be studying for a semester. I managed to get my internship company to sponsor the ticket (it makes sense in a very convoluted way: the internship offer included a round trip ticket home - a way to attract foreign students perhaps - but since I wasn't going home, nor was I going to my next destination from Beijing, they obliged to buy me a ticket from wherever I'd be at the end of my mid-semester vacation, to wherever I was going to end up next (most people would go home; I was going to Germany). I had a deadline, and a starting point. What I'd do in between was to be played by ear. After my first backpacking trip, I'd proven to myself that the benefits to planning in advance were not greater than the drawbacks - freedom to improvise and deviate from the plan with no repercussions - and so for nearly all my trips since then, I'd made a concerted effort to plan nothing, all leading up to a peak of spontaneity (after several years of honing the craft) wherein I'd show up in a country not knowing where I'd sleep that very night... and be totally fine with it.   
<br/>


So I started in Bangkok and made my way South, the entire time anticipating my enigmatic destination, which I'll describe to you here (for the time being foregoing the intermediate journey, which is worth a few entries in itself).

I took an overnight train from Kuala Lumpur to the train station at Woodlands, in the very north part of Singapore. On the train, the lights were left on overnight. This is a pet peeve of mine ever since those overnight seated train rides on 2nd and 3rd class cars of the slow trains in China, where people are prone carouse all through the night - they tend to really make the most of their holiday time up until the very last second. But the difference here was that this traincar was almost entirely free of passengers. I was in a seat with retina-scalding fluoescent lamps above me, in silence, for nine hours, overnight. I tried to catch some shuteye by tying a jacket around my head (a good tip by the way, on any flight or voyage where you don't have an eye-cover (but better yet, just get yourself an eye-cover)).  
<br/>

I made it through the night only scalding my retinas a couple times when trying to adjust my head-jacket, and arrived in Singapore early in the morning. This would be first of many times I'd cross through immigration between Malaysia and Singapore - a fact I could never have known then.

But wait. What *is* Singapore anyway? At that time, knew very little. I'd met some traveling Singaporeans in Beijing who built up a very mysterious image in my head about the island-country. And after my three-day trip, I can't say that that mystery was very much solved. All I knew before my trip was that:   
<ol>
<li><p>Singapore was a thriving, modern city-state in Southeast Asia (I would have previously guessed, just going by the name, that it was situated in a less East part of Asia), and </p></li>
<li><p>Singaporeans could speak fluent English and Chinese (I'd met a Singaporean tourist in Beijing a few weeks earlier. "<i>Who is this strange East-West hybrid person who could speak both languages fluently!?</i>")</p>
</li>    
</ol>
Seeing as I, someone who's mother tongue is English, spent the past six months convincing myself that Mandarin is an incredibly hard language to learn *because* it's so different from English - and then seeing a Singaporean person going around speaking both like its no big deal, left an impression, to say the least. To say the most... well, it sort of shattered my worldview when it came to languages and worldviews.    
<br/>

You see, I had spent those entire six months trying to remold my worldview to be able to contain the outlook on the world which comes from the <a href="/2020/06/25/mandarin-state-of-mind"> connotations and implications of the Chinese language</a>?, which I'd considered to be very different from the worldview I'd previously had, which was solely built upon the way the English language represented it. So for someone to natively have those two worldviews coexisting and able to be seamlessly accessed instantaneously and according to the cultural scenario as needed was something which I couldn't wrap my head around. *Singaporeans were special*.     
<br/>

But that was only one side of it. While in China, I'd also become familiar with the ways in which Chinese people found English to be difficult, both in pronunciation, and concept-structure, and so I convinced myself that the languages were simply too different for anyone to really be fluent in both to a native level. The conceptual frameworks between the two of them were incompatible, I believed. And conversely, I was fully convinced that anyone who *did* manage to obtain a level of comprehension of both languages to a level that was close to fluency, would have an *extreme* advantage over anyone who did not - simply because of an implied ability to wade effortlessly through a vast sea of cultural compatibility, with all the social and professional benefits that could provide.

To this day, I'm not sure I fully understand the way having two of perhaps the most disparate languages in the world be absorbed into your mind at a young and developing age affects worldview, if at all. But I do know that Singapore, and Singaporeans, *are special*.    
<br/>

The city itself is an anomaly. A modern metropolis grounded in a layer of ancient cultural roots, with architecture representing some of the most futuristic I've seen, while also being interspersed with homages eclectic mix of ethnicities that make up its population.    
<br/>

To be clear, Singapore is not a paradise, nor is it my favorite place on earth. But it is a unique place which has the ability to reshape the way one sees the world; a place where, after having been there, you become better aware of the idea that human potential has no or few bounds - *where there's a will, there's a way*. All that being somewhat mindblowing considering that I, and many others unfamiliar with the region, may have never even known it existed, or else if we did, had no idea where in the world it was.

My three-day visit went by in a blur. As the tail end of a whirdwind of a trip across three countries in Asia, it was more of a wind-down sort of stay. Aside from notably tumultuous journey from the train station to the city featuring an emergency seach for a public restroom (for anyone who intends to visit Malaysia for the first time, consider yourself warned), the rest of it involved: hanging out in my quaint hostel lobby, chatting with other travelers - were they as stupefied by the anomalousness of the city as I was? - some shady nighttime walks, and a taste of the local cuisine, which is largely a mix of Chinese and Malaysian flavors. But as much as the details of that trip have escaped me, the impression of the trip was significant. Singapore has become a recurring theme throughout my life since then, and almost, what I might have one time considered, a sort of home-base in Asia for me.    
<br/>

On the third day, I boarded the plane at Changi airport - the most luxurious airline I'd ever taken (the first time I wasn't given a hard time trying to get a vegetarian meal on the plane) had a layover in Abu Dhabi, and then landed in my next destination - Germany - where yet another entirely different sort of worldview-shaping experience would take place. But I'd be back in Singapore soon enough.
