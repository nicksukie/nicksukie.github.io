excerpt: And preservation of memories in words when there are no pictures

My second backpacking trip ever started in Bangkok. But I did not intend to stay there. I was interested in nature - beaches and palm trees. I arrived at night, and booked a hostel in one of the tourist areas of the city. Walked through but not participate in any other the [nightlife activities](/assets/images/SE-Asia-early/soi-cowboy.JPG) (simply observing, as I've written before, was one of my pastimes in those days). The following day I headed to the trainstation and purchased a combo bus-ferry ticket to an island off the Eastern coast of the country. I had a few hours to spare, so I walked around the neighborhood. I ventured into Chinatown by foot. Had lunch. My mind was in a very strange place - I'd just flown in from *China*, and now here I am, in Chinatown of a country neighboring China. _Why does this feel more like the Chinatown in my hometown than a town in China?_ I wondered, a mysterious I have yet to reconcile completely, even after having visited dozens of Chinatowns around the world since.

I meandered with my overly-stuffed backpack back to the train station, having to put it down every so many steps because of the weight (travel tip, if you are travel in between living in two different countries, rather than bringing all of your belongings with you, consider shipping some to your next destination, or if that's too expensive, leave them with friends in the previous country, and come get them later. If anything, you'll have a good excuse to come visit that place again). Finally in the crowded trainstation, I had a few hours to spare. Not being at to sit still for even a moment, I got up and explored the station. I came across a stall selling mobile phones. I thought, this might not be the best place to get a phone, but...  
<br/>

Two days earlier...  
<br/>

I was getting ready to leave Beijing. I returned my bike and phone to one of the three proprietors of the now defunct internship agency which provided them six moths earlier. Upon meeting him one weekday morning outside his apartment building, he told me: 1) he was not aware of the bike at all and 2) that I could keep the phone, an inexpensive entry-level smartphone. Also my first ever smartphone. I told him I'd just spent several hours the night before cleaning off all my data and that I'd like to give it back, as I was expecting to ([sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) in action). He obliged.

And so now, two-days later, I'm without a smartphone, starting a new trip in a Bangkok train station looking at smartphones. Although I knew there was something shady about it, I couldn't resist. It was a white Samsung with a steel-blue backplate. It looked and felt so fresh. And it also worked, surprisingly. I bought it. $50. In those days, I barely knew what a smartphone was for. It was unlikely that I'd need to call anyone during my trip, and I had a nice camera with me, so I didn't need it to take pictures. But I had recently sold my soul for a scholarship, which I'd only get if I created vlog of my time in the study abroad destination I'd be going to after the current trip (another post on that soon). So I needed one.  
<br/>

A month later, it broke. I don't regret it. If it had lasted any longer, I would have lost many more pictures than I did. What I regret is the next phone I bought, for more than $50 (not a bootleg this time), the SD card for which crapped out on me almost a year later. (Why did I use the SD card instead of the internal storage? Was there not enough space, or was I simply unaware of the fallibility of the soon-to-be-obsolete-and-for-good-reason miniature piece of plastic as an unreliable place to store some of my life's most precious memories? I can't say. What I can say though is that now I always automatically backup my pictures to Google photos.)  
<br/>

More than a thousand pictures - taken across three countries of temporary residence and several more just passing through - gone. At the time, it didn't have an effect on me. I was still experiencing the adrenaline rush of living in a foreign country. Only after that sensation wore off, and I started to settle down into something of a *normal* life, did it start to feel like a loss. So here I am writing. Telling those stories in whatever way I can. For no other reason than to let them be told. Because in some strange way, I feel like doing so will be doing justice to those lost photos. No, not as two-dimensional representations of a moment in time at a particular place, but to the stories - and the feelings - behind those moments.

I boarded the train. The seat transformed transformer-like into a bed. I drifted off and when I awoke, the sunrise shone through traincar curtains. I brushed them aside. Trees, blurring past. Yellow morning sunlight, almost blinding. Soon I'd be transferring to a bus, and then a ferry. The trip had officially begun.
