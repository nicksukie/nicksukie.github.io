The first time I ever went abroad was a volunteer trip to Costa Rica during my second year of college. Needless to say, it was as eye-opening as could possibly be. I loved every second of digging holes into the ground for compost, planting seeds, tending to the crops. I took into the sun, the sounds, the smells, and tastes. I learned to appreciate nature and the moment for the first time.  
<br/>


That's really what it's all about: <em>the moment</em>.   
<br/>


Some people play sports. Some play music. I travel. These are all activities that enforce a state of being which allows one to be fully present. Maybe I chose the most expensive one. But it worked out, because it was all on loan. Much like someone would take out a bank loan to start a business, hoping that they'll soon earn enough in profit to pay it back, I traveled on scholarships during college, hoping, or rather, assuming, that the person I would become as a result would equip me with tools to achieve success (both and material, and spiritual).   
<br/>


I find the benefits of travel endless, because the flexibility of it - the adventure - is something that gives you back whatever you put into it. By traveling, you're not only becoming good at traveling; if done a certain way, traveling can help a person get better at "life" itself. The demands it has on the mental and emotional faculties: the necessity of planning, interacting at various levels of formality, negotiating, coming up with solutions to problems expected and unexpected.   
<br/>


Traveling is what you make of it. And I made it into a tool to push myself to my limits. Pushing myself in a way which would force me outside my comfort zone, as far as possible as fast as possible - if nothing else, to see what I could handle.   
<br/>


Some might said it's an addiction. The adrenaline rush of being surrounding by nothing familiar. And maybe it is. But if you can pull it off, why not? There's no downside.

The rest was definition a combination of youthful naivety (especially about money and finances), and <em>momentum</em>. I felt like I would be letting myself down if I went home. But that feeling in turn was a result of the continued growth I experienced by being abroad. And so like that it continued for several years, a vicious cycle of opportunity, growth, ignorance, and stubborn persistence...  
<br/>



But there were definitely other factors of my personality that made travel the perfect "sport" for me.   
<br/>


Ever since I started learning Spanish in school, I loved learning languages. In fact it was the only subject in school I actually enjoyed. because it didn't feel like school. It felt like preparation for life. And so traveling was just an endless immersive language course where I was experiencing life at the same time as I was gaining skills which would be useful and make the experience more enjoyable the more I learned: in very perceptible ways.   
<br/>


Traveling without knowing a language can be enjoyable in a recreational sort of way. But knowing the language adds another dimension to it. It's almost like you're looking into a window onto a world you weren't supposed to see. Being able to interact with people who only use that language then, is like being a part of a science-fiction novel, having traveled to an alternate reality, where everything works <em>slightly</em> differently than the way you're used to.  
<br/>


<em>[Side note: I'd also generalize this point to say that the fact that people tend judge others based on their own standards and expectations of their own culture can cause misunderstanding to the point of hatred, which, in extreme cases, can turn into violence. Language matters.]  </em>
<br/>

<hr class="hr2">  
<br/>

And finally, we come to the very personal factor: family. For certain reasons in my upbringing, I started out in life a bit further behind in terms of knowing who and what and where I wanted to be when I grew up.   
<br/>


Traveling was a way for me to see how people lived in the world outside of my small realm of awareness and understand that there is, indeed, a place for me in this world. In short, it gave me meaning. That meaning is more of a refinement of character as opposed to something that can be clearly defined. In a basic form, it makes me look like a person who is in a way defined by having traveled the world, but from my perspective, having traveled the world is simply a means to an end; the end being me as a person who is aware of different cultures and languages, and thus has a broad perspective on the world such that he (I) can observe without judgment - well at least, that's what I like to think.  
<br/>
 

This is where my life's journey has reached the boundary of being based around traveling, to being based around non-judgement. Because, having spent some time at home (this post is being written in August 2020, so you know why), I have practiced my understanding of non-judgement gained in the international context by applying it to life locally, and have found that it is just as applicable. People are people everywhere, and while there are geographies which awaken a person more than others, the prospect of travel itself, purely wandering the way I used to - no longer appeals to me. Instead, I intend on expanding that understanding of non-judgement further to encompass more and more of my life, and find joy in the moments wherever I am. Surely, I will never tire of seeing new places in the world, meeting new people, new experiences. Having lived abroad is one of the things that most defines me, and that will never change. But the emphasis has shifted, and now the adventure continues on yet another dimension - the one where meaning is derived from output rather than intake. Sharing my pictures, stories, thoughts, and beliefs with the world. This is my new adventure, and I'm glad that you're following along.
