It was a Saturday afternoon and I found myself in a small village on the outskirts of the city. It was a long day, half of it already spend doing tai chi with an old master and his younger disciple, who was my teacher, but also an adventure companion, as you'll see shortly.  
<br/>

We walked from the Dojo to the bus stop on the main road: one way, an hour ride back to the edge of the city; the other, a range of mountains as far as the eye could see. We grabbed some snacks from a convenience shop on the side of the road and we brainstormed the best way to make use of the rest of the day. I had no other plans, and neither did my tai chi teacher. So we made a deal: we'd hop on whichever bus came first, regardless of which way it was going. A: back to the city, B: towards the distant mountains, to who knows what destination might lie that way.  
<br/>

We rang up our snacks, and as we walked back down to the road, just in time, a bus came.  
<br/>

From the fact that this story is worth writing, you should already have guessed that the bus which came first was B, the one going towards the mountains - into the unknown. My tai chi teacher and I boarded.  
<br/>

By this point on the bus route, there were not many people on board. There was, however, a young man who seemed to be going to the same place we were, although at that moment we knew not what it was. My tai chi teacher made some brief conversation and shared some snacks with the young man, although he seemed mostly uninterested in the shenanigans of the taichi teacher and his foreign friend. He was on a mission.  
<br/>

There was a vague understanding that, at the end of the route, there was a temple, and the young man was going to volunteer there. We, of course, stayed on till the end.  
<br/>

The bus dropped us off at the end of a long pathway leading up a hill, fronted with a concrete arch. And at the top of the hill was the mountain which we saw in the distance, or a stretch of it, at least. But before the mountain was a temple, just as we were told. But it was not just any temple. It was a gigantic complex of intricately designed wooden and stone structures which may have been home to some hundreds of people, and a place of work and worship to some hundreds more. It was a monastery, and, as I never could have known at the time, one of the foremost ones in the entire country.

The young volunteer walked off quickly, but not before letting us know that we could, too, volunteer if we wanted to. And so next thing you know we're in the administrative office, presenting our ID's and receiving volunteer badges. By now it was getting dark. "Evening prayer starts in 30 minutes". We were shown to a dorm which housed about 3 wooden framed bunk beds - everything was made of wood here - and were acquainted with our roommates for the night. I made some small talk with one of them, we exchanged contacts; long since lost to the realm of cloud-heaven.  
<br/>

Soon we were rushed off to evening prayer. We entered a vast hall. The session was just beginning. The room lined with several rows of tables. Men and women standing beside them, looking to the front of the room, prayer books in hand. Our volunteer friend from the bus caught glimpse of us, but quickly looked away. Were we committing some sort of faux pas? Was there a specific way we should have entered the prayer hall? Or maybe we were late, and the session was halfway over.  
<br/>

We found some empty spaces at a table. A prayer book was procured from somewhere and ended up in my hands. Before I knew it, the room was resonating with the voice of a hundred people chanting in unison.  
<br/>

Afterward evening prayer I took a walk around the monastery grounds. The city was visible in the distance, immersed in an ethereal red glow - a product of city lights refracted by the everpresent fog.  
<br/>

I went back to the dorm and turned in for the night.  
<br/>

<hr class="hr2">  
<br/>

I was awoken at 4am by a loud, piercing noise coming from the hallway. It was the sound of someone repeatedly banging two pieces of wood together. A wake-up call, summoning everyone out of bed and up to the main hall for morning prayer.  
<br/>

Then, after prayer, breakfast. The morning light shone horizontally into the mess hall. Total silence as the meal was underway, aside from the clinking of chopsticks against metal bowls. Volunteers coming around to offer seconds. People were using a form of sign language to convey to the server whether, and how much rice, porridge, or vegetables they desired.

Something about that place - the sounds, the silence, the simplicity, the sunlight and the mountainside - bestowed a sense of peace. It hinted at something I didn’t previously know existed. Maybe there was something more to life than what I knew, some goal of fulfillment deeper than that obtained from the mad rush towards financial or career success.  
 
<br/>

That day was spent not in the monastery but exploring the mountainside, hiking through the web of trails which were possibly traversed by monks for centuries. 
 
<br/>

<br/>

Had I not gotten on that bus, I think I may still have found out about that monastery and gone out of my way to visit it. It had that sort of fateful feeling, as if the gears of whatever universal forces which were acting on me at that time were pulling me in its direction, and it only took my nonresistance to the pull to actually arrive there.

I went back again a few weekends later. This time, I actually did some work as a volunteer. I swept the floors, served, and even prepared some of the food - some of the most savory and flavorful vegetarian dumplings I’ve ever had. And then, soon, back to city - mundane life once again.  
 
<br/>

Is there really something deeper to life than what I'd always known? Some form of happiness whose only requirement is the acceptance of simplicity? If so, it sounds like I have a long way to get there. And I still have yet to confirm it. But for now, <em>at least I have a hint.</em>
