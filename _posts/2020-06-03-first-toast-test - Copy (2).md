I picked up an old and unused bike from my old apartment building. I had to change the front wheel, fix the breaks and stuff then just started riding it. I was stopped by the police one day and explained the whole story to them. They believed me, but told me that I couldn't just do that, because if it is in fact stolen, I am in posession of it thus am the prime suspect for the theft of it.
They rang the previous owner (from the details on the sticker on the bike) and confirmed with her whether it was stolen or not, and she said she left it at the apartment building when she moved out, thus confirming my story. The police told me I should then get it registered in my name as the previous owner didn't care what happened to the bike. I never did though, and continued to ride it for about 5 years or so. I was stopped on the odd occasion and had to explain the same story again, but as it was written up in the first place, it could always be confirmed. 
I would go to the koban and tell them the situation before riding the bike around and get them to check with the previous owner. Once that is cleared, register it in your name and all is good
