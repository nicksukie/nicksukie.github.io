In the time before I learned how to budget comprehensively, which was relatively late in life given a complete lack of regard for anything financial - whether due to rebellion or a side effect of systemic cultural neglect -  I'd typically live a very frugal lifestyle, not knowing when or if I was approaching the limits of my means. I'd simply live on as little as possible - an unintentional minimalist, you could say. The alibi was that I was a student, and the fact that students are looked on universally as justified in being poor, I was able to make it work.  
<br/>

But there would be times when I was suddenly imbued with the prescience of obligation to budget, and at such moments I was sometimes pleasantly surprised, as it turned out in the story I am now going to tell.   
<br/>

<br/>

I was approaching the end of my intership period in Japan, and I had been lucky enough to lifehack my way through living abroad for a year and a half already on scholarships and stipends (no, not academic scholarships... more so, "there are not many people interested in going to this part of the world so let's entice them with free money" type scholarships). I also happened to be lucky to cross paths with people who were of the impression, as I am, that unpaid internships are slave labor and so not only was I living on a university stipend but one from the company of employment as well. None of this was deliberate, it was just the way the chips fell.  
 <br/>

And so upon calculating with a few weeks left in Japan, I found that I had a moderately substantial sum of savings which had accumulated as a result of living ignorantly minimalistic all that time - what would amount to $100 a day until the day I'd leave Japan if I wanted to spend it all. I could choose to put it towards tuition, but that was covered by loans. In my mind, a loan was a loan to be paid back later, and not to be thought about until then (kids, don't do what I did). And not to mention, I was in _Japan_. When I got back home, I'd stay with parents. I'd have practically no living expenses for at least a semester, at which point I'd get a part time job and move back to the campus to provide for myself until graduation (tuition of course, still out of sight, out of mind).   
<br/>

In a #YOLO moment (or rather a #YOIJO moment, which in hindsight was actually a #YORIJO moment), I decided to spend as much as possible of it before I went home.   
<br/>

What I quickly learned was that deciding what to spend money on was _hard_ when you had a lot of it. Now I understand why Bill Gates has dedicated the later phase of his career to philanthropy. Deciding where to allocate an excessive amount of money is a full-time job in itself. For me, it would be a few weeks. For Bill, it's going on a couple _decades_.  
<br/>

By now, your probably wondering what I did with all that extra capital.   
<br/>

Here's the answer (spoiler: it's be much less exciting than you hoped).  
<br/>

First, I went to the ground floor of the [Tokyo Skytree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Skytree), and bought lots of souvenirs. Just my luck, I found a shop that sold postcards for only a hundred yen (a dollar) each. I bought lots of them, along with other various cultural items that would be of interest to friends and family: calligraphy brushes, [sushi magnets](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-fake-food-became-90-million-dollar-industry-japan-2019-1), tea leaves, matcha kit-kats, all that unique-to-Japan goodness. Following with that theme, I then went to [Tokyo Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower), another landmark of the Tokyo skyline - a structure which interestingly, could be easily mistaken for the Eiffel Tower from afar - which had a much less assuming and less elaborate souvenir market at its base. There I purchased - you guessed it - more souvenirs. This time, shirts and clothing.  
  <br/>
I also came up with what I thought would be the most culturally appropriate souvenir idea, which, to my dismay, happened to be one of the cheapest things to buy in Japan: chopticks, which  are sold in various shapes, sizes, colors, and designs in any 100 yen shop. I went crazy, hopping all around the city, buying pairs for not only friends and family back home, but for my co-workers whom I'd be leaving very soon. I'll let you decide what kind of impression I made with such a parting gift.   
<br/>

Now let's get to the juicy stuff.  
<br/>

I had lots of good meals. I had lots of good drinks. And yes, I got a massage. But not the kind you're thinking (there's so much to be said about massages, I'll have to dedicate a post to them at some point in the future). And finally, I thought what better way to heave a huge chunk out of the savings than to take another trip! So I decided to book my ticket home from Seoul, Korea, and flew there from Tokyo four days before that flight. That trip was a wind-down sort of trip. A "who knows when the next time I'll be in Asia so I'd better do as much as possible, but I'm also totally exhausted from already going all-out in Tokyo for the past couple weeks" kind of trip. So I rented my first ever Airbnb, single room, also for the first time on any of my travels. And slept, *way too much*. There are some vague memories of large pots of stew, a quick encounter with an old friend, thoughts of how similar Seoul looks to my hometown (?), and then, suddenly, I was there. Back home. Looking at me, you'd could never tell I'd been away that whole time. Maybe I wasn't... maybe it was all... a dream?  
<br/>

Nah, I had a luggage full of chopsticks. It must've been real.
