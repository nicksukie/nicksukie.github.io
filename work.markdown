<p><strong> I write a blog as a hobby, but by trade, I write something quite different - code. I've been interested software ever since getting my hands on computers and video games as a young child. I'm passionate about creating intuitive user experiences which enable people to interact and express themselves in new and productive ways.

 I'm also available for freelance web-development work on a per-project basis.</strong>

 <em><strong>Here's the story of my professional journey up to now:  </strong></em>  
<br/>


My first foray into software development was in my first year of college when I attempted to "disrupt" the exorbitant textbook industry by creating a sharing platform for students to exchange books across the campus. I put together a basic landing page, but soon, the only thing I managed to disrupt was my grades, and so my software aspirations had to be put on hold for a few years. That first venture, though, as shallow as it was, gave me my first exposure to HTML, CSS, and the dynamics of a CMS, which would prove useful later in the professional setting.   
<br/>


### Student Phase: Co-ops & Internships   

Outside of coursework, where I learned MatLab, mostly for performing complex mathematical computations in (non-software) engineering homework assignments, Isoon started programming with Python. My second co-op during my undergrad (a five-year, three co-op program featuring alternating 6-month work and study periods for three out of the five years, no summer breaks) was a data science role for the R&D department of an environmental engineering company. I took what I knew about MatLab, and scaled that up with mentorship from a great supervisor and plenty of Stackoverflow, tutorials, and trial and error - to gain a beginner's proficiency in the language. By the end of the six months, I'd been able to produce some significant results for the company, as well as make a mssive leap in my programming abilities as compared to when I started at the company. My accomplishments there included a desktop application for data analysis and visualization of R&D data, as well as a digital image processing tool to classify highspeed images of moving particles according to their speed and orientation.

Finally, during the same co-op I worked on yet another desktop application, originally developed by a previous intern, which utilized an API from NASA to generate combustion reaction information at a user-designated range of conditions. On this project, I did not work much with the calculations aspect, but I revised the user interface and the output graphs for the reactions. As such, one could say this was my first UI/UX design project, another skill which would, in a very early instance of foreshadowing, pave the way for my future career.

<br/>


Although my major at the time was not related to IT or computer science, I had always had programming as a passion, and knew I'd get back into it as a career at some point later in life (why I didn't think to study it in college is a conversation for another day). But with that passion in the back of my mind, I decided to do something risky, and take an internship in the field, which was actually completely unrelated to my major at that time - a decision based on instinct which proved to be a good one (what is life but a game challenging you to know when and when not to trust your instincts?). During the final co-op during my undergrad, I worked as a web developer for a Tokyo based compliance startup. I designed from scratch a website for the company's international product suite, and revised the bilingual corporate website as well, all using WordPress. I designed icons, wrote copy, integrated translations, and formatted all the pages using Wordpress's WYSIWYG platform along with some custom HTML and CSS, and deployed it at the very hesitant nod of the company CTO, making this my first complete web project (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131185851/http://www.shimpla.com/en/"> it shows</a>).   
<br/>

While there was only a small portion of line-by-line programming in this role, it did give me a stronger conceptual understanding of web-development and UI design, and inspired me to further delve into the field. It also provided a soft-landing for my entrance into web-development, given that the website was intended as a showcase of products and not a representation of a company as a whole (who would hire a mere intern to take on such a huge responsibility?). I was graciously given the chance to perform a task which I'd had the desire but not yet the competency to do, simply out of the goodness of heart to give an young ambitious person a chance, and for that I'm deeply grateful. Because, as blank canvas of a student with little concrete idea of what he wanted to do as a profession, this was the first role I've performed which I've felt fully "in my element", so to speak, where the previous was saisfying to certain extent, it was still further on the scientific side than I'd find myself inclined to delve into further. As such, if I can find that level of comfort in a future role, I'll know that I'm in the right place. 

<br/>
<hr class="hr2">  

At this point, the trend throughout my studies was that my work interests were becoming much less *scientific* and much more *design-oriented*. Whereas a field of "hard-engineering" relies upon scientific laws and mathematical equations, I was starting to lean more towards a field dominated by intuition and consumer preferences (of course, software engineering has a basis of science, but at its highest level, it is abstracted such that those mathematical fundamentals are almost invisible to the end-user).   
<br/>


### Graduate Phase: Research

With this intuition-based leaning and a foundation of programming and web-development skills in tow, I combinaed all that with my interest in scalable platforms, as hinted at in my first-ever software endeavor, I decided to pursue my most ambitious project yet. I fully-fledged social media platform in a niche which I felt was lacking - news.  
<br/>

<div class="center mx-auto">
  <img src="/assets/images/work/IF1.png" class="inline-block mr3" style="width: 80%;">

<span class="img-caption mb3">The resulting news discussion/aggregation platform which I developed during my master's, intended to create a "healthier" ecosystem for online news.</span>

</div>

The idea was this: While the existing web ecosystem would have it such that one could comment on individual articles on individual news websites, and could also comment on articles posted to social media, there was no platform where one could see all comments to a given article, regardless of where it was shared, all in one place. I thought such a paradigm would contribute to less of a echo-chamber effect, where people on social media only see the content that they tend to agree with, and thereby reduce the phenomenon of confirmation bias, where people become more ingrained in their existing believes because they are not exposed to alternate viewpoints. Idealistic to the max!  
<br/>

This project led me down a long long rabbit-hole, which did, I admit, pull me somewhat further into a research direction than the simple software solution I had originally envisioned - a Facebook-like content sharing platform which would sort content by topics and categories rather than by user who shared them. Said research emphasis was spurred in large part by the fact that I was participating in a research-based master's degree program, which also had a significant entrepreneurship element to it, intending to impart both the technical skills and real-world people skills necessary to run a startup tech company. Through such an unconventional academic program structure, I gained an side-understanding of the implicit contradiction between pure technological "innovation", and business viability. Suffice it to say, it took me two-years and countless research-inspired pivots before the beta was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84mIVltoqo&feature=emb_title">released</a>, by which point, my development partners moved on to bigger and (presumtively) better things, and I was left with a massive AWS deployment of a hefty web-app containerized with Docker, and literally zero prior knowledge of dev-ops. Now freshly graduated, and with no sustained means of funding (the master's was fully funded), it became clear to me that I was in over my head, and I retired the application.  
<br/>  


And thus, a supposedly simple news-discussion/aggregation platform had evolved into a research project capped off with a <a href="https://github.com/nicksukie/inflo-pub/blob/master/README-longversion.pdf">one-hundred page thesis</a> going into the technological, economic, and behavioral aspects of bias, misinformation, and clickbait on social media platforms and how one could go about reducing them, using the platform as a case study to that end. But for as much as I got sidetracked by the research aspects, I also gained competency in several new areas of software development. So while the application itself will fade into the recesses of some academic database somewhere along with my thesis, I managed to take away some essential skills from the experience: namely, I overcame my fear of everything backend, seeing as all my experience prior involved only frontend; I learned the dynamics of APIs and web services; I gained competency in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03781">machine learning and natural language processing </a>; and finally, got a handle on my first commercially desirable web development frameworks: Django and React. I also made a decent looking <a href="https://infloproject.com/"> landing page</a> in preparation for a hypothetical marketing phase which never materialized.  
<br/>


Oh, and through the same project, I did discover the meaning of life. Well, ok, not quite, but I'd like to think I discovered something important about human nature: that bias is an inherent part of who we are and because no single person can see all sides of a situation, it's impossible to be unbiased. Therefore, the only thing we can do is choose not to act on our biases at an individual level, rather than waiting for a platform to mass eliminate all user biases - an impossible goal. What technological solutions <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/good-intentions-only-mean-so-much-in-startup-world-4a7c3ace6814?source=friends_link&sk=4213afe53ba504c4c96e176bb7fb1c5f">can do</a>, however, is aggregate viewpoints, and allow users for themselves to decide which information to trust and/or adopt as their own view.  
<br/>

Overall, through my master's program and software project, I gained a more realistic view of software development, and life itself, making my personal and professional goals more straightforward and realizable.  
<br/>
 
### Graduate Phase: Startups  
The learnings from academic life, admittedly, tend to be unapplicable to the real world. So, being a fan of the real world, I was eager to escape from the relative isolation of campus life and get involved in some startups, to counterbalance the relative isolate of campus life.   
<br/>

One of which was Oodymate, a social platform for travelers to <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/oodymate-food-local"> find meal buddies in foreign destinations</a>. I worked alongside the founder from conception to release, providing qualitative feedback on UI design, user flows, and feature specifications, as well as coordinated work between the product and engineering teams. Finally, I spearheaded the branding direction and early marketing efforts upon the release of the beta, which spawned an almost unexpected byproduct - a series of meetup events revolving around food, which currently boast membership of several thousand members across three cities in Asia. Using real-world events as a marketing tool, then, has proven to be a highly effective idea, as long as one can then make the transition from offline participant, to active user of the application.

<span class="img-caption mb3">The user-flow for event creation in Oodymate, a platform to connect people together for a meal, especially while traveling.</span>

</div>


Another startup I worked with had both hardware and software components, and was a device for mental relaxation. After completing a successful Kickstarter campaign, they enlisted me to the team to assist with rolling out successive versions of the mobile app, making appropriate additions and pivots according to user demand and feedback. I drew up wireframes for a handful of potential features, and after deciding with the founding team on which ones best aligned with the future direction of the business, assisted the lead developer with implementation, provided an iterative series of revised wireframes until all specifications were pinned down and ironed out. Those features are currently deployed in the latest version of the application, which, along with the hardware product, are gaining significant traction in the market.   
<br/>

### Work-Life-Travel Balance

Along my professional journey I've also been fortunate to have had the opportunity to delve somewhat into the digital nomad community, a burgeoning trend among young software developers, who, taking advance of the ability to work remotely as a programmer, choose to live in countries which may correspond better with their intended lifestyle - and budgets - leading to a potentially healthier work-life balance while also gaining some understanding of cultures of different people around the world.    
<br/>


<div class="center mx-auto">
  <img src="/assets/images/work/nomad.jpeg" class="inline-block-3" style="width: 80%;">

<span class="img-caption mb3">The much sought after nomad view. What I later realized is that it would be amuch nicer view without the computer in the way.</span>

</div> 
While I think the trend of nomadism looks, for the most part, more glamorous than it actually is, having experienced it first hand makes me better able to determine my future career path knowing all possible the options. Not to mention, the prospect of combining two passions of mine - travel and technology - is something that would have been a lingering "to-do" until I did it. So now, with that experience checked off, I can move on to a more stable, and potentially more realistic lifestyle, taking what I've learned about work-life balance from that period of voluntary instability, and using that to form a healthy balance wherever my career takes me in the future.    
<br/>
Remote work can be seen as the ultimate luxury for any software engineer, and while it's something to strive towards, it's probably not a realistic expectation for an early-stage in one's career, where - the way I see it - the priority should be on learning, improving skills, and networking. Lifestyle balance is important, but priorities should take into account long-term achievement as well as short-term comfort. That being said, I'm a proponent of utilizing one's vacation days! I believe the brain needs a break sometimes, so that the soul can be nourished.
